# MenuMines

A minimalist Minesweeper for your menu bar.

## What is MenuMines?

MenuMines is a menu bar Minesweeper game for macOS that brings the classic puzzle to your fingertips:

- **Always accessible** - Lives in your menu bar, one click away
- **Daily puzzle** - Same board for everyone, every day
- **No decisions** - Just open and play, no setup required
- **Distraction-free** - No dock icon, no clutter

## Installation

### Download

Download the latest release from the Releases page.

1. Download `MenuMines.dmg`
2. Open the DMG and drag MenuMines to Applications
3. Launch MenuMines from Applications
4. Click the MenuMines grid icon in your menu bar to play

### Build from Source

Requires Xcode 15+ and macOS 14+ (Sonoma).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeriMeriMeri/menumines.git
cd menumines
xcodebuild build \
  -scheme MenuMines \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=""
```

Build products are generated in Xcode DerivedData (default) unless you override output paths.

## Distribution

MenuMines supports two distribution channels with separate builds:

| Channel | Target | Update Mechanism | Signing |
|---------|--------|------------------|---------|
| App Store | MenuMines | App Store | Apple Distribution |
| Direct | MenuMinesDirect | Sparkle | Developer ID |

### App Store Release

Triggered by pushing a `v*` tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`):

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The `release.yml` workflow archives, signs, and uploads to App Store Connect.

### Direct Distribution Release

Triggered by pushing a `v*-direct` tag (e.g., `v1.0.0-direct`):

```bash
git tag v1.0.0-direct
git push origin v1.0.0-direct
```

The `release-direct.yml` workflow:
1. Builds with `Release-Direct` configuration
2. Signs with Developer ID certificate
3. Notarizes with Apple
4. Creates a signed DMG
5. Signs the release for Sparkle auto-updates
6. Generates `appcast.xml`
7. Creates a GitHub Release with DMG and appcast

### Direct Release Lessons (Sparkle + Notarization)

A few hard-won constraints to keep in mind when shipping outside the App Store:

- **Treat “Direct” as a separate product**: keep a distinct target/build config (and often bundle ID) so entitlements, signing, and update behavior don’t accidentally affect the App Store build.
- **Sign *everything* inside the app bundle**: the main app, frameworks, login items/helpers, and any embedded tools all need consistent Developer ID signing.
- **Notarization is a pipeline, not a checkbox**: common failures come from missing hardened runtime, incorrect entitlements, unsigned nested binaries, or packaging the wrong artifact.
- **DMG matters**: users experience the DMG first. Make sure the DMG is **signed**, **notarized**, and (ideally) **stapled** so Gatekeeper behaves nicely offline.
- **Sparkle updates require a stable feed + signing key hygiene**:
  - keep the **appcast URL stable** and versioned entries correct
  - keep the **Sparkle private key private** (rotate if ever exposed)
- **Versioning must be consistent**: ensure the version/build numbers Sparkle reads match what you publish in releases/appcast.

### Required GitHub Secrets

#### App Store (release.yml)

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64` | Base64-encoded Apple Distribution certificate |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Certificate password |
| `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded provisioning profile |
| `ASC_API_KEY_P8_BASE64` | Base64-encoded App Store Connect API key (.p8) |
| `ASC_KEY_ID` | App Store Connect API key ID |
| `ASC_ISSUER_ID` | App Store Connect API issuer ID |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Apple Developer Team ID |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Optional: Sentry DSN for error tracking |

#### Direct Distribution (release-direct.yml)

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_BASE64` | Base64-encoded Developer ID Application certificate |
| `DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_PASSWORD` | Certificate password |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID for notarization |
| `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD` | App-specific password for notarization |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Apple Developer Team ID |
| `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` | Sparkle Ed25519 private key |
| `SPARKLE_PUBLIC_ED_KEY` | Sparkle Ed25519 public key |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Optional: Sentry DSN for error tracking |

### Generating Sparkle Keys

After adding the Sparkle package, build the project to generate the key tool:

```bash
# Build to fetch Sparkle package
xcodebuild -scheme MenuMines-Direct -configuration Release-Direct

# Find and run the key generator
./DerivedData/MenuMines-*/SourcePackages/artifacts/sparkle/Sparkle/bin/generate_keys
```

This outputs:
- Private key saved to `~/.sparkle_private_key`
- Public key printed to stdout

Add both keys to GitHub Secrets as described above.

## How to Play

Clear the 9x9 board without hitting any of the 12 hidden mines.

### Controls

| Action | Mouse | Keyboard |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Reveal cell | Left-click | Space |
| Toggle flag | Right-click or Control+Click | F |
| Move selection | - | Arrow keys |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ⌘R | Reset game |
| ⌘, | Settings |
| ⌘Q | Quit |

### Rules

- Numbers show how many mines are in adjacent cells (including diagonals)
- Flag cells you think contain mines
- Reveal all non-mine cells to win
- Hit a mine and it's game over

## Daily Board

Every day, MenuMines generates a new puzzle using a deterministic seed based on the date. This means:

- Everyone gets the same board on the same day
- You can compare times with friends
- Come back tomorrow for a fresh challenge

Continuous Play is enabled by default. After completing the daily puzzle, you can keep playing unlimited random puzzles. Only the daily puzzle counts toward streaks.

Note: if the first click lands on a mine, the mine is relocated using system randomness. In that edge case, boards may diverge across players after the first click.

## Accessibility

MenuMines is designed to be fully playable with VoiceOver:

- **Screen reader support** - All cells and controls have descriptive labels
- **Keyboard navigation** - Full game control via arrow keys, Space, and F
- **State announcements** - Win/loss states are announced automatically

To enable VoiceOver, press Cmd+F5 or go to System Settings → Accessibility → VoiceOver.
