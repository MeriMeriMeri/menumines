# MenuMines - Development Guide

## Project Overview

MenuMines is a menu bar Minesweeper game for macOS. It features a 9x9 board with 12 mines, generating the same daily puzzle for all players using deterministic seeding.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Swift 5.9+
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI
- **Target:** macOS 14+ (Sonoma) - required for @Observable macro
- **Key APIs:**
  - `MenuBarExtra` with `.window` style for rich popover UI
  - `GameplayKit` `GKLinearCongruentialRandomSource` for seeded RNG
  - `NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents` for keyboard input
  - `SMAppService.mainApp` for Launch at Login (no UserDefaults — system is source of truth)

## Key Patterns

### Game Logic is Pure Swift
All game logic (`Board`, `Cell`, `GameState`) has no UI dependencies. This enables comprehensive unit testing without SwiftUI test harnesses.

### Views are Stateless
Views read from `@Observable GameState` and call methods on it. No view-local game state.

### Daily Seed Formula
```swift
// IMPORTANT: Use UTC timezone so all players get same puzzle globally
var calendar = Calendar(identifier: .gregorian)
calendar.timeZone = TimeZone(identifier: "UTC")!
let seed = Int64(year * 10000 + month * 100 + day)
// Example: 2024-03-15 → 20240315
```

### Agent App Configuration
Set `LSUIElement = YES` in Info.plist to hide from Dock. The UI must provide a Quit button since there's no Dock icon to right-click. `LSApplicationCategoryType` is set to `public.app-category.utilities` (not `puzzle-games`) to prevent macOS Game Mode from activating.

## Direct Distribution & Sparkle Auto-Updates

The app ships two variants: **App Store** (MenuMines target) and **Direct** (MenuMinesDirect target). The Direct build uses Sparkle 2.x for auto-updates.

### How Updates Work

- **DMG** is for first-time manual downloads (drag-to-Applications UX)
- **ZIP** is for Sparkle auto-updates — Sparkle handles ZIP natively without XPC installer services
- The `appcast.xml` `<enclosure>` points to the ZIP, not the DMG
- Release notes use inline `<description><![CDATA[...]]></description>` in the appcast (not `<sparkle:releaseNotesLink>` which renders the full GitHub page in Sparkle's WebKit view)
- Custom release notes can be passed via `RELEASE_NOTES_HTML` env var; defaults to a generic message

### Entitlements

The two targets use separate entitlements files:

- `MenuMines.entitlements` — App Store target: sandboxed (`com.apple.security.app-sandbox`)
- `MenuMines-Direct.entitlements` — Direct target: **not sandboxed**, only `network.client`

The Direct build must NOT be sandboxed. Sparkle's installer fails with sandbox enabled because its XPC services cannot communicate through the sandbox boundary. The App Store target stays sandboxed as required by Apple.

### Release Flow

Both `scripts/release-direct.sh` and `.github/workflows/release-direct.yml` follow the same pipeline:

1. Build & archive with `MenuMines-Direct` scheme / `Release-Direct` configuration
2. Notarize the app, then create and notarize the DMG
3. Create a ZIP from the same staged `MenuMines.app` for Sparkle
4. Sign the **ZIP** (not DMG) with Sparkle's `sign_update` tool
5. Generate `appcast.xml` with inline release notes and ZIP enclosure
6. Upload DMG + ZIP + appcast to GitHub release

### Key Files

- `MenuMines/Info-Direct.plist` — `SUFeedURL`, `SUPublicEDKey`, `SUEnableAutomaticChecks`
- `MenuMines/UpdateManager.swift` — `SPUStandardUpdaterController` init (behind `SPARKLE_ENABLED` flag)
- `MenuMines/MenuMines-Direct.entitlements` — unsandboxed entitlements for Direct build

## Releasing

See the [Distribution section in README.md](README.md#distribution) for release workflows, tag conventions, and required GitHub Secrets.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build release
xcodebuild -scheme MenuMines -configuration Release

# Run tests (code signing must be disabled to avoid Team ID mismatch errors)
xcodebuild test -scheme MenuMines CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=""

# Clean build
xcodebuild clean -scheme MenuMines
```

## Testing Requirements

**Tests must always be run:**
- After any substantive code change, even if not explicitly asked
- Before every commit

This is non-negotiable. CI does not run on PRs, so local test runs are the only safeguard.

## Accessibility

MenuMines must be fully playable with VoiceOver. Accessibility is a core requirement, not an afterthought.

### Required Accessibility Features

1. **Cell Labels** - Every cell needs a descriptive accessibility label:
   - Hidden cells: "Row X, Column Y, covered" or "Row X, Column Y, flagged"
   - Revealed cells: "Row X, Column Y, [number] adjacent mines" or "Row X, Column Y, empty"
   - Mines: "Row X, Column Y, mine"

2. **State Announcements** - Use `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement` to announce:
   - Game win: "Congratulations! You won in X seconds"
   - Game loss: "Game over. You hit a mine"
   - Timer updates (on demand, not continuously)

3. **Keyboard Navigation** - Already implemented via arrow keys + Space/F (see Controls)

4. **Control Labels** - All buttons need accessibility labels:
   - Reset button: "Reset game"
   - Timer display: "Elapsed time: X seconds"
   - Mine counter: "X mines remaining"

### Implementation Notes

```swift
// Cell accessibility label example
.accessibilityLabel(cellAccessibilityLabel(row: row, col: col, cell: cell))
.accessibilityHint("Double-tap to reveal, or use F to flag")

// State announcement example
AccessibilityNotification.Announcement("Game over").post()
```

### Testing Accessibility

Use these tools to verify accessibility:
- **Accessibility Inspector** (Xcode → Open Developer Tool): Check labels and traits
- **VoiceOver** (Cmd+F5): Play through the entire game with VoiceOver enabled
- Test all game states: initial, in-progress, won, lost

## Code Style

- SwiftLint with default rules
- No force unwraps (`!`) - use `guard let` or `if let`
- Prefer `struct` over `class` where possible
- Use `@Observable` (Swift 5.9) over `@ObservableObject`

## Game Constants

- Board size: 9x9 (81 cells)
- Mine count: 12
- **Daily puzzles**: the board is fully determined by the seed and is never modified during
  play. Mines are placed avoiding a seed-derived opening cell, and that opening is revealed
  when the board is created, so every player starts from the identical position. Opening a
  mine loses — nothing is relocated to protect the player.
- **Random puzzles**: first click is always safe; mines are relocated out of a 3x3 around the
  click via `clearAreaForOpening`, so the board depends on where the player clicked.

The split exists because relocating mines around the first click made two people playing the
same daily play *different* boards, which also meant their shared grids never matched. Do not
reintroduce relocation for daily puzzles — `DailyBoardFairnessTests` guards this.

## Workflow

### Linear
User stories are tracked in Linear under the MenuMines project.

**Before starting work:**
1. Move the issue to "In Progress" status
2. Read the full issue description to understand acceptance criteria
3. Check blocking issues are resolved

**While working:**
- Commit incrementally as you complete parts of the story
- Update AGENTS.md with new learnings or instructions

**When done:**
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Leave the issue in "In Progress" status (do NOT move to "Done" - another process handles that)

### Linear Details
- Organization: `merimerimeri`
- Project: MenuMines (`sweep-f5976e94df09`)
- Issue prefix: `MER` (e.g., `MER-23`)
- Workflow: Todo → In Progress → Done

## State Management Rules

The app maintains consistent behavior across resume, pause, completion, and recovery scenarios.

### Completion
- **Completion = win or loss**: A daily puzzle is complete when the game status becomes `.won` or `.lost`
- Both outcomes mark `dailyCompletionSeed` in UserDefaults
- Both outcomes record stats (once per day, deduped by seed)

### Timer Behavior
- **Starts**: On first `reveal()` call (not on flag)
- **Pauses**: When menu bar popover closes (`onDisappear`)
- **Resumes**: When popover reopens (`onAppear`) if status is `.playing`
- **Stops**: On win, loss, or reset

### Reset Lock
- Once today's puzzle is complete (win or loss), reset is disabled for the rest of the day
- `canReset` checks `isDailyPuzzleComplete()` using UTC date
- Enforced in: HeaderView emoji, FooterView menu, keyboard shortcut (⌘R)

### Persistence

**Storage Keys:**
- `gameSnapshot`: Active game state (cleared when starting random puzzles)
- `gameSnapshot.daily`: Completed daily puzzle with full board state (preserved until day changes)
- `dailyCompletionSeed`: Tracks if today's puzzle was completed
- `dailyStatsRecordedSeed`: Prevents duplicate stats recording
- `dailyStats_<seed>`: Stores DailyStats struct for each completed day

**IMPORTANT: The daily namespace (`gameSnapshot.daily`) is absolutely necessary.**

When a user completes a daily puzzle with continuous play ON, then plays random puzzles, then turns continuous play OFF, they must see their completed daily puzzle with the exact revealed cell pattern—not a fresh hidden board. The stats fallback only stores metadata (won/lost, time, flags) but NOT the board state. The daily namespace preserves the full board state so the visual representation is correct when toggling continuous play off.

Do NOT attempt to simplify by removing the daily namespace in favor of stats-only restoration.

### Error Recovery
When app launches:
1. Try to load snapshot → restore full state if valid and today's seed
2. If snapshot missing/corrupted but daily complete → restore from stats (won/lost, time, flags)
3. Otherwise → fresh game with today's board

### Share Availability
- Share button visible when `status == .won || status == .lost`
- Persists after relaunch because snapshot preserves status

### Daily Seed
```swift
// All date-based logic uses UTC timezone
let seed = Int64(year * 10000 + month * 100 + day)
// Example: 2026-01-25 → 20260125
```

## Testing Strategy

Core game logic must be thoroughly tested since we use concrete types without protocols. Test the actual classes directly—no mocks needed.

**Required coverage:**
- Unit test all game logic (Board, GameState, DailyBoard functions)
- Test win/lose conditions
- Test reveal cascading behavior
- Test first-click safety (mine relocation)
- Test timer start/pause/resume behavior
- Test deterministic seeding produces identical boards
- Test UTC timezone consistency (same Date produces same seed regardless of local timezone)
- Test keyboard selection movement and bounds

**Accessibility testing (required before release):**
- Verify all cells have correct accessibility labels
- Test full game flow with VoiceOver enabled (Cmd+F5)
- Confirm win/loss announcements are spoken
- Verify keyboard navigation works with VoiceOver focus

**Optional:**
- UI testing (focus on logic correctness first)

## Localization

The app is structured to support future localization. Follow these guidelines to keep it localization-ready.

### String Handling

**Never hard-code user-facing strings.** All text shown to users must go through the localization system:

```swift
// ❌ Bad - hard-coded string
Text("Reset")
Button("Quit") { ... }

// ✅ Good - uses String Catalog / Localizable.strings
Text("reset_button", tableName: "Localizable")
Button(String(localized: "quit_button")) { ... }
```

**Emojis are locale-independent** and don't need localization: 🚩, 💣, 🙂, 😎, 😵, 🎉

### Localizable.strings

All user-facing text is in `MenuMines/Resources/en.lproj/Localizable.strings`. This includes strings for buttons, menu items, accessibility labels, share text, and stats display.

When adding new user-facing strings:
1. Add the key-value pair to `Localizable.strings`
2. Use `String(localized:)` or `Text(_:tableName:)` in code
3. Use descriptive keys that indicate purpose, not content

### Date and Number Formatting

**Use locale-aware formatters** for user-facing dates and numbers:

```swift
// ❌ Bad - assumes specific locale format
let dateString = "\(month)/\(day)/\(year)"
let priceString = "$\(amount)"

// ✅ Good - respects user's locale
let dateString = date.formatted(date: .abbreviated, time: .omitted)
let priceString = amount.formatted(.currency(code: "USD"))
```

**Exception:** The game timer (`%02d:%02d`) is intentionally locale-independent since `MM:SS` is a universal stopwatch format, not a localized time display.

**Exception:** The daily seed calculation must always use UTC timezone to ensure all players worldwide get the same puzzle - this is not a localization concern but a game design requirement.

### Testing Localization

When adding localized strings:
- Test with different system languages to catch layout issues
- Verify strings don't get truncated in UI
- Check that emojis render correctly across locales
