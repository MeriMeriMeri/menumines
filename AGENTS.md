# Sweep - Development Guide

## Project Overview

Sweep is a menu bar Minesweeper game for macOS. It features an 8x8 board with 10 mines, generating the same daily puzzle for all players using deterministic seeding.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Swift 5.9+
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI
- **Target:** macOS 14+ (Sonoma) - required for @Observable macro
- **Key APIs:**
  - `MenuBarExtra` with `.window` style for rich popover UI
  - `GameplayKit` `GKLinearCongruentialRandomSource` for seeded RNG
  - `NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents` for keyboard input

## Key Patterns

### Game Logic is Pure Swift
All game logic (`Board`, `Cell`, `GameState`) has no UI dependencies. This enables comprehensive unit testing without SwiftUI test harnesses.

### Views are Stateless
Views read from `@Observable GameState` and call methods on it. No view-local game state.

### Daily Seed Formula
```swift
// IMPORTANT: Use UTC timezone so all players get same puzzle globally
var calendar = Calendar(identifier: .gregorian)
calendar.timeZone = TimeZone(identifier: "UTC")!
let seed = Int64(year * 10000 + month * 100 + day)
// Example: 2024-03-15 → 20240315
```

### Agent App Configuration
Set `LSUIElement = YES` in Info.plist to hide from Dock. The UI must provide a Quit button since there's no Dock icon to right-click.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build release
xcodebuild -scheme Sweep -configuration Release

# Run tests
xcodebuild test -scheme Sweep

# Clean build
xcodebuild clean -scheme Sweep
```

## Accessibility

Sweep must be fully playable with VoiceOver. Accessibility is a core requirement, not an afterthought.

### Required Accessibility Features

1. **Cell Labels** - Every cell needs a descriptive accessibility label:
   - Hidden cells: "Row X, Column Y, covered" or "Row X, Column Y, flagged"
   - Revealed cells: "Row X, Column Y, [number] adjacent mines" or "Row X, Column Y, empty"
   - Mines: "Row X, Column Y, mine"

2. **State Announcements** - Use `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement` to announce:
   - Game win: "Congratulations! You won in X seconds"
   - Game loss: "Game over. You hit a mine"
   - Timer updates (on demand, not continuously)

3. **Keyboard Navigation** - Already implemented via arrow keys + Space/F (see Controls)

4. **Control Labels** - All buttons need accessibility labels:
   - Reset button: "Reset game"
   - Timer display: "Elapsed time: X seconds"
   - Mine counter: "X mines remaining"

### Implementation Notes

```swift
// Cell accessibility label example
.accessibilityLabel(cellAccessibilityLabel(row: row, col: col, cell: cell))
.accessibilityHint("Double-tap to reveal, or use F to flag")

// State announcement example
AccessibilityNotification.Announcement("Game over").post()
```

### Testing Accessibility

Use these tools to verify accessibility:
- **Accessibility Inspector** (Xcode → Open Developer Tool): Check labels and traits
- **VoiceOver** (Cmd+F5): Play through the entire game with VoiceOver enabled
- Test all game states: initial, in-progress, won, lost

## Code Style

- SwiftLint with default rules
- No force unwraps (`!`) - use `guard let` or `if let`
- Prefer `struct` over `class` where possible
- Use `@Observable` (Swift 5.9) over `@ObservableObject`

## Game Constants

- Board size: 8x8 (64 cells)
- Mine count: 10
- First click is always safe (relocate mine if needed)
- If the first click hits a mine, relocation uses system randomness (boards can diverge after that first click)

## Workflow

### Linear
User stories are tracked in Linear under the Sweep project.

**Before starting work:**
1. Move the issue to "In Progress" status
2. Read the full issue description to understand acceptance criteria
3. Check blocking issues are resolved

**While working:**
- Commit incrementally as you complete parts of the story
- Update AGENTS.md with new learnings or instructions

**When done:**
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Move the issue to "Done" status

### Linear Details
- Organization: `merimerimeri`
- Project: Sweep (`sweep-f5976e94df09`)
- Issue prefix: `MER` (e.g., `MER-23`)
- Workflow: Todo → In Progress → Done

## Testing Strategy

Core game logic must be thoroughly tested since we use concrete types without protocols. Test the actual classes directly—no mocks needed.

**Required coverage:**
- Unit test all game logic (Board, GameState, DailyBoard functions)
- Test win/lose conditions
- Test reveal cascading behavior
- Test first-click safety (mine relocation)
- Test timer start/pause/resume behavior
- Test deterministic seeding produces identical boards
- Test UTC timezone consistency (same Date produces same seed regardless of local timezone)
- Test keyboard selection movement and bounds

**Accessibility testing (required before release):**
- Verify all cells have correct accessibility labels
- Test full game flow with VoiceOver enabled (Cmd+F5)
- Confirm win/loss announcements are spoken
- Verify keyboard navigation works with VoiceOver focus

**Optional:**
- UI testing (focus on logic correctness first)
